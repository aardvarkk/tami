# Dependencies

APU -> FDS, S5B, DPCM, MMC5, N163, VRC6, VRC7, Mixer, Noise, Square, Triangle

FDS -> FDSSound
S5B -> emu2149
VRC7 -> emu2413

# Reminders

- Removed FDSSound __fastcall in headers and cpp files (it's MS/x86-specific)
- Lots of changes to Blip_Buffer around long, unsigned long, LONG_MAX etc. assumed to be 32-bit and short assumed to be 16-bit
- Blip_Buffer output is 16-bit signed (Blip_Buffer.h:14)
- APU output is 32-bit signed (APU.cpp:232)

# Loading a file

- BOOL CFamiTrackerDoc::OpenDocument(LPCTSTR lpszPathName)
  - Relies on CDocumentFile (which sits on top of CFile)

# Playing

- CSoundGen is shared between main thread and player thread
- CSoundGen::StartPlayer (public)
  - PostThreadMessage(WM_USER_PLAY)
    - Takes something that could be called from main thread and puts it into its own (player) thread
    - e.g. StartPlayer
  - ON_THREAD_MESSAGE(WM_USER_PLAY)
  - CSoundGen::OnStartPlayer (public)
  - CSoundGen::BeginPlayer (private)
  - Checks that it's being called from the *player thread*
  - Requires a document, tracker view, and sound channel
  - For document, need to call AssignDocument (happens on construction)
  - For tracker view, need to call AssignView (happens on construction)
    - BOOL CFamiTrackerApp::InitInstance() -> RUNTIME_CLASS(CFamiTrackerView)?

## Setting DirectSound channel
- Happens on ResetAudioDevice
  - Which happens on InitInstance of CSoundGen and also OnLoadSettings()
  - Which must be part of CWinThread
  - But document and view are already supposed to be set at that point
  
# DirectSound Approach
- read and write cursors with settable position
- Lock() the buffer then write to it (WriteBuffer())
  
- CSoundGen::StartPlayer is called from *main thread*
  - Posts a thread message of WM_USER_PLAY
  - Picked up by CSoundGen::OnStartPlayer on *player thread*
    - Calls CSoundGen::BeginPlayer which does all the work
    
- CSoundGen::OnIdle (primary player thread loop)
  - called when no thread messages are being performed
  - checks if a document is loaded
  - CSoundGen::UpdateAPU
    - APU::Process
      - APU::EndFrame
        - calls FlushBuffer on its IAudioCallback (defines a FlushBuffer call)
        - CSoundGen::FlushBuffer
          - called from player thread (implies APU runs in player thread)
          - calls fillbuffer at either uint8 or int16 sample size
          - CSoundGen::FillBuffer
            - CSoundGen::PlayBuffer
              - waits for a "buffer event" of BUFFER_IN_SYNC and then writes to the buffer
              - CDSoundChannel::WriteBuffer
  
# TODO
- app::initinstance constructs soundgen but *also* creates the suspended thread
  - it then calls soundgen::initializesound and then resumes the thread
- doc and view *require* theapp to have soundgen pointer
- soundgen::initinstance must be run in player thread *and have doc and view set*
  - there seems to be a race condition where initinstance is called from the createthread *before* doc and view have finished constructors,
    which means that soundgen doesn't have assigned view and document
  - i think that would have to happen as a side-effect of createthread (called from famitrackerapp)
  - which means we actually need to support the initially-suspended thread thing?
  - do a suspend count like windows
